        <p class="paragraphs"> My entire life I have been drawn to art.  I remember sitting in preschool with markers in my hand, instead of running around playing with the other kids.  I remember bringing my "My Little Pony" coloring book to school in the second grade, and spending all of my free time coloring.  One of the most significant times in my life regarding arts was the during the summer before I entered fourth grade. I went to summer school and I remember there being a class that taught the children who joined how to knit.  I was so intrigued, but instead I joined an improv class.  However, later that summer, I found something in a small store called a loom.  I begged my mother to buy it for me, and thus began my love for knitting, crocheting, and all things yarn.  I thought myself to knit on the loom, making countless beanies, scares, and teddy bears.  I attempted knitting with needles, but the tedious craft only frustrated me and I swore I would never knit again.  But, one day I met a girl in my fifth garde class.  She came into class with a bag full of yarn and some interesting sticks.  I watched the girl create a small scarf out of a white ball of yarn.  Extremely compelled to learn this new art, I insisted she teach me.  I began my own little creations, and soon found out that I was learning the basics of crocheting. I also found out that my grandmother was also once incredibly skilled at crocheting, and with her help, I soon became "hooked" on crocheting. Since that year, I have made so many small crafts for my family, friends, and myself.  </p>
