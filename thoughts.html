                <p> Following your journey.</p>

              
              <p> I think that everyone has one definite mission in life : to be happy.  Everyone on this planet wants to be happy.  The road to being happy is different for everyone. Whether its from wealth, or just simply making someone else smile, everyone wants to reach a point in their life when they feel complete.  For me, feeling "complete" has been a long journey, one that I am traveling on.  There will always be bumps along the road, as you've probably heard so many times before.  But I like to think about my life, and my journey, on a deeper level.  As a disclaimer, I would like to note that I accept all religions as possibilies, and I respect any beliefs one may have. However, I consideer myself to be more of a spiritual person, rather than a religious one.  Without further ado, welcome to thoughts. </p>

            <h1 class="importantHeadings"> Choices </h1>
                <p> To be happy or to be sad.</p>
                <p> Everyday you make choices in life.  You decide to hit the snooze button eight times, you decide to make scrambled eggs for breakfast, and you decide to take the same route every morning to work.  These choices, as insignificant to your life as they may seem, ultimately add up together to make something I like to call "Your Movie". There is a reason you do things the way you do.  There is a reason you do things a certain way.  There is reason for every single thing that happens in your life, and you are in charge of everything that happens.  Even the things that seem out of your reach are there for a reason, and you still make the choice for those things to be in your life. <br> Some days I find myself worrying about different aspects in my life.  Over time, I wanted to find a way to live  a happier life, one without anxiety and overly intense sadness.  Though I still get sad, though I still have my share of anxiety attacks - I have taught myself how to be a happier person.  For as long as I can remember, my mom has always told me something that I will never forget.  Whenever I was upset, she would tell me the same phrase : "Everything happens for a reason."  I carry this with me all the time, never allowing myself to dwell on unfortunate situations.  And at times in my life, I look back on my past and realise how those "bad times" have built me into a stronger person in the longrun.  These forlorn events are things that need to happen for you to evolve.  You learn and you grow on your mistakes.  I like to think of the universe as a teacher.  In school, we learn, we make mistakes, and we grow based on those errors.  After working on something in school, you are given a test.  Anything that seems like a great misfortune is actually quite the contrary.  Pass the test, and move forward with your journey.  Make the choice to look at all positivities in life, and to grow on the negativities.
