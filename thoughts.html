                <h1> The Mission in Life </h1>
                <p> Following your journey.</p>

              <p> I think that everyone has one definite mission in life : to be happy.  Everyone on this planet wants to be happy.  The road to being happy is different for everyone. Whether its from wealth, or just simply making someone else smile, everyone wants to reach a point in their life when they feel complete.  For me, feeling "complete" has been a long journey, one that I am traveling on.  There will always be bumps along the road, as you've probably heard so many times before.  But I like to think about my life, and my journey, on a deeper level.  As a disclaimer, I would like to note that I accept all religions as possibilies, and I respect any beliefs one may have. However, I consideer myself to be more of a spiritual person, rather than a religious one.  Without further ado, welcome to thoughts. </p>
