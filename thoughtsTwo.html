            <p> The effects of neglection. </p>
            <p>
                I find that in life, you will always experience periods of sadness, but once you figure out how to deal with them, you will be granted with true bliss.  Your feelings are meant to be treated with care.  You should never neglect a bad thought, or any negative feelings.  This goes for anything: instead of trying to ignore your pain, nurture it.  Sometimes, it may become neccessary for you to ask for help when dealing with pain.  Communication is one of the best tools in any situation.  Telling someone that you are hurting will help, because now you are learning how to deal with your pain, instead of wasting your efforts on hiding them.  After discussing how you feel, you will notice a weight being lifted from your chest.  Now someone has the chance to help you, and to stand by your side through this recovery.  Do not neglect your emotions.  Treat your mind with kindness, after all, the way you think and feel about a situation is a direct connection to who you are as an individual.  Your sentiments are defined by your personality.  Do not neglect your emotions, for it will only cause your mind more anguish.  Learn how to nurture your sufferings, and move past them.  Your aching will not last forever, and you will always get through tough times.  What matters the most is learning to endure your sorrows, and grow from them.
